### About Refunds – You're Fully Covered
If you haven't received your product or there's any qualifying issue:

- We **initiate your refund immediately** once approved—right away on our end.
- **Please note**: Banks and payment processors typically take **3-5 business days** to show the refund in your account (sometimes up to 7 days in rare cases). This delay is standard and outside our control, but rest assured—the refund is sent the moment we process it. Most customers see funds back quickly within 3-5 days.
